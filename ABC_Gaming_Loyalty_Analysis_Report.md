## Part B: Bonus Allocation Strategy

### Budget: ₹50,000 for Top 50 Players

#### Recommended Strategy: Enhanced Tiered System

**Tier Structure:**

- **Champion (Rank 1)**: ₹3,000
- **Elite (Rank 2-5)**: ₹2,000 each
- **Premium (Rank 6-15)**: ₹1,500 each

**Total Allocation**: ₹48,000 (96% budget utilization)

#### Alternative Strategies Evaluated:

1. **Equal Distribution**: ₹1,000 per player
2. **Loyalty Proportional**: Based on loyalty points percentage
3. **Hybrid Approach**: 50% loyalty + 25% games + 25% equal

#### Rationale for Recommended Strategy:

- **Excellence Recognition**: Substantial rewards for top performers
- **Motivation**: Clear incentive structure for improvement
- **Fairness**: All top 50 players receive meaningful rewards
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Competitiveness**: Encourages players to aim for higher tiers

## Part C: Loyalty Formula Evaluation

### Current Formula Issues

#### 1. Deposit Bias (~70% of total points)

- High-deposit players dominate rankings regardless of engagement
- Creates unfair advantage for wealthy players
- Reduces competitive balance

#### 2. Withdrawal Rewards (Counterintuitive)

- Players earn points for withdrawing money
- Encourages cash-out behavior
- Contradicts loyalty program objectives

#### 3. Minimal Activity Recognition (~2% of total points)

- Very low weight for transaction frequency
- Insufficient incentive for platform engagement
- Undervalues customer stickiness

#### 4. Undervalued Gameplay (~15% of total points)

- Low points for actual gaming activity
- Doesn't reflect platform engagement
- Misaligned with business objectives

### Proposed Improved Formula

```
Loyalty Points = (0.005 × Net_Deposit) + (0.3 × Games_Played) +
                (0.02 × Transaction_Frequency) + (0.1 × Games_Won)
```

#### Component Definitions:

- **Net_Deposit**: Total Deposits - Total Withdrawals (only positive values)
- **Games_Played**: Total number of games participated
- **Transaction_Frequency**: Number of deposit transactions
- **Games_Won**: Number of games won (skill recognition)

#### Improvements:

1. **Balanced Weight Distribution**:

   - Gameplay: ~60% of total points
   - Net Deposits: ~25% of total points
   - Transaction Frequency: ~10% of total points
   - Win Bonus: ~5% of total points

2. **Engagement Focus**: Prioritizes active platform usage
3. **Skill Recognition**: Rewards player performance
4. **Gaming Prevention**: Eliminates withdrawal point exploitation
5. **Fairness**: Provides more equitable competition

### Impact Analysis

**Example Comparison:**

- **High Roller** (₹10k deposits, ₹2k withdrawals, 20 games, 8 wins):

  - Current Formula: 114.8 points
  - Improved Formula: 46.9 points

- **Engaged Player** (₹1k deposits, ₹500 withdrawals, 100 games, 40 wins):
  - Current Formula: 32.5 points
  - Improved Formula: 34.7 points

**Result**: Improved formula better rewards engagement over pure spending power.
